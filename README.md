# ampersand-auto-closing-view [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ben-eb/ampersand-auto-closing-view.svg?branch=master)][ci] [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ampersand-auto-closing-view.svg)][npm] [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/ben-eb/ampersand-auto-closing-view.svg)][deps]

> A view that closes itself after a certain period of time.

Install via [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/ampersand-auto-closing-view):

```
npm install ampersand-auto-closing-view --save
```

## Example

A simple example might be to show a prompt each time the user moves his/her
mouse. It could look like this:

```js
var View   = require('ampersand-view');
var ACView = require('ampersand-auto-closing-view');

// Extend the view so that we can have custom HTML instead
var MyACView = ACView.extend({
    template: '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>'
});

var MyView = View.extend({
    template: '<div class="container"><div class="prompt"></div></div>',
    events: {
        'mousemove': 'reset'
    },
    reset: function() {
        this.acView.trigger('reset');
    },
    render: function() {
        this.renderWithTemplate();
        this.acView = new MyACView();
        this.renderSubview(this.acView, '.prompt');
    }
});

var myView = new MyView({ el: document.body });
myView.render();

```

We can go a little further with this, and keep the view persisted whilst the
user has his/her mouse over our custom view:

```js
var MyACView = ACView.extend({
    template: '<h1>Hello, world!</h1>'
    events: {
        'mousemove': 'onMouseMove',
        'mouseout' : 'onMouseOut'
    },
    onMouseMove: function(e) {
        e.stopPropagation();
        this.trigger('stay');
    },
    onMouseOut: function(e) {
        e.stopPropagation();
        this.trigger('reset');
    }
});
```

Note that this module leaves the hide/show implementation up to you - at its
most simple, you can define these two classes in your CSS file:

```css
.hidden {
    display: none;
}

.active {
    display: block;
}
```

Or, make it look a little smoother by defining a transition between the two
states:

```css
.prompt {
    position: absolute;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 200px;
    height: 100%;
    background: #222;
    transition: transform .2s ease;
}

.prompt.hidden {
    transform: translateX(-200px);
}
```

## API

`ampersand-auto-closing-view` is itself an [ampersand-view][amp-view] so you can
extend it to add additional functionality. This is recommended as this module
provides only a skeleton view which you can then fill with your own content.

### new ACView(options)

Construct a new auto closing view with an options object. The following options
are supported:

#### duration
##### type: `Number`
##### default: `4000`

The duration, in milliseconds, that the element should be shown for.

#### activeClass
##### type: `String`
##### default: `active`

The class name to use whilst the element is active.

#### hiddenClass
##### type: `String`
##### default: `hidden`

The class name to use whilst the element is hidden.

### ACView.hide()

"Hides" the view. Note that you should supplement this with your own CSS; this
is so you can animate the view in and out using CSS transitions. Does not start
the timer.

### ACView.show()

"Shows" the view. Note that you should supplement this with your own CSS; this
is so you can animate the view in and out using CSS transitions. Does not start
the timer.

### ACView.reset()

Reset the timer for the view, keeping it on screen for the duration that was
defined (default is 4 seconds). Note that you can also do
`ACView.trigger('reset')`.

### ACView.stay()

Convenience for clearing the timer and showing the view with a single method
call. Note that you can also do `ACView.trigger('stay')`.

### ACView.clear()

Clears the timeout for the view, so that you can (temporarily) override the
show/hide behaviour. For example, when you mouse over the view, it could stay in
place until you mouse out of it again.

Pull requests are welcome. If you add functionality, then please add unit tests
to cover it.
